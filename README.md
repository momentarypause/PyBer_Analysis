# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
### Data
The following data was collected for 2,375 Pyber Rides in 120 cities from January 1, 2019 through May 8, 2019:
- City --Name and type (urban, suburban, or rural)
- Date and time of ride
- Fare collected
- A count of drivers available in each city (total drivers: 2,973)
- Ride ID number

### Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the data collected in order to increase access to ride shares in underserved neighborhoods and to determine the affordability of rides for that population.

## Results

### Urban
Urban data shows 780 more drivers than rides.  This tells me that there is either a very high turn-over rate for urban drivers or that there are a large number of inactive drivers.  This throws off the average fare per driver making it seem like it is much less than it actually should be.
### Suburban

### Rural
Rural is, by far, has the least representation of the city categories.  This tracks with National Census Bureau data that states that in 2010, [19% of the country's population lived in rural communities.](https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=49cd4bc9c8eb444ab51218c1d5001ef6) This number has been slowly declining since then as more and more people move to urban areas and the suburbs. There are significantly less rides, drivers, and total fare collected for rural communities




## Summary
Data analysis often raises more questions to explore than provides answers.

Driver count is higher than the ride count signifying that there are many drivers who did not accept rides during a 4 month period. How many drivers are inactive?  I wonder how the stats would change if we just counted active drivers.  What areas do these inactive drivers drive for?  

Why is there less representation in rural areas?  Less driver interest in
