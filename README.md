# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
### Data
The following data was collected for 2,375 Pyber Rides in 120 cities from January 1, 2019 through May 8, 2019:
- City --Name and type (urban, suburban, or rural)
- Date and time of ride
- Fare collected
- A count of drivers available in each city (total drivers: 2,973)
- Ride ID number

### Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the data collected in order to increase access to ride shares in underserved neighborhoods and to determine the affordability of rides for that population.

## Results

### Urban

### Suburban

### Rural
Rural is, by far, the least active of the categories.  This tracks with National Census Bureau data that states that in 2010, [19% of the country's population lived in rural communities.](https://mtgis-portal.geo.census.gov/arcgis/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=49cd4bc9c8eb444ab51218c1d5001ef6) This number has been slowly declining since then as more and more people move to urban areas and the suburbs. 

Driver count is higher than the ride count signifying that there are many drivers who did not accept rides during a 4 month period
